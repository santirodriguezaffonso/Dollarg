# Dollarg

This App aims to show us the dollar's value in Argentina. Because in this country happens something strange and this is that you have a few different prices for a single dollar.

So to express these values, I will use an API from "DolarSi" that retrieves the different dollars in Argentina. These will display in a SwiftUI `List` using Cards and `NavigationLink`.

Also, will be a login UI to save user configs by using `UserDefaults`.
